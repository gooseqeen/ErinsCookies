             <p>Hi I’m Erin and I love cookie season because selling cookies for my family makes them happy and have a smile on their face, and I love seeing others happy.  It's also just fun selling things in my opinion. I also had a really good time figuring out how we were going to sell cookies this cookie season. I especially worked hard on the Digital Cookie website since Caitlin was coding this website, and  I wanted to finish our project in a few days. This cookie season is going to be  amazing and possibly even more than that. Enjoy your cookies, and have an amazing day!</p>

             <h3>Bio:</h3>
             <p>I overall found it really fun to create a website and girl scout cookie business with my sister. I was able to improve my knowledge in HTML coding, and begin my journey in Javascript and CSS. I also was in charge of any illustrations for the website as well, and I had lot’s of fun with that as well. Though I assisted with the process of making this website, I have to credit Erin with the work and dedication she gave to this website and congratulate her on the effort she put into it! I hope that me and Erin can reach as many people as we can with this website, to not only share it with them but give them the flavourful experience of some tasty girl scout cookies!

             <h3>You have questions, and we have answers!</h3>
             <h4>Here are some of our most frequently asked questions:</h4>
             
             <div id=box>
               <h4>Why did you make the website in addition to your digital cookie website?
               </h4>
               <p>The reason why we made a website is because we wanted our website to answer users questions, and for it to be basically an attachment or an extension  to the Digital Cookie website.

               </p>
              </div>

            <h4>Why are you just not going to people's houses and giving them cookies?</h4>
            <p>The reason why is because covid is still happening so we don't know if we should be going to go to people’s houses. I just think it will be easier selling cookies on our website.
            </p>
            <div id=box>
               <h4>What is your goal with selling cookies?
                </h4>
               <p>My goal with cookie selling is to be able to reach 150 packages. The reason why I want to reach my goal is because last year I didn’t reach my goal, so this year I really want to sell cookies.
                 </p>
            </div>
            <h4>What’s the best thing about selling girl scout cookies?
            </h4>
            <p>The best part of cookie selling is seeing people happy and maybe trying something new, and falling in love with it. Another reason why I absolutely love cookie selling is seeing how much more I can sell each year and learning how to be a leader.

            </p>
            <div id=box>
              <h4>Why did Caitlin code the website instead of Erin?</h4>
              <p>Hey, Caitlin here. We both had a bit of a rough cookie season last year, and wanted to sell more cookies this year than ever before, so we decided to team up. My troup wasn't selling cookies, so I worked extra hard on helping my sister by coding. I may have coded and designed certain features of the website, but Erin made all of the major and small decisions for us. Hopefully one year I will be able to teach what I've learned, and we'll make the website together! </p>
            </div>
          <p>This may or may not need to be said, but we <strong>do not own</strong>girl scout cookies. We are just girl scouts looking to reach customers with our own website. </p>
